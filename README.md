# KNUST-COC Evangelism Flutter App

## Project Overview

This Flutter and Firebase application empowers KNUST-COC to streamline church outreach efforts through efficient prospect management and focused evangelism activities. It adheres to the **Clean Architecture principle**, ensuring a well-structured and maintainable codebase.

## Key Features

### Prospect Management

1. Effortlessly add new prospects with relevant details.
2. View and manage existing prospect information.
3. Employ a robust search functionality to quickly locate specific prospects.

### Location-Based Data

1. Organize prospect data based on their location for targeted outreach.
2. Generate location-specific PDF reports for offline access, fostering evangelism activities on the go.

### Multiple Locations (Single Active)

1. Support the management of outreach efforts across multiple locations within KNUST-COC.
2. Maintain a single active location at a time to guarantee focused evangelism campaigns.
3. Access historical prospect data from past active locations for comprehensive recordkeeping.

### Firebase Integration

1. Leverage Firebase's robust features for secure data storage, authentication, and real-time synchronization (if applicable).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Flutter and Dart development tools installed on your system. Refer to the official Flutter documentation for detailed setup instructions: <https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install>
Create a Firebase project and configure it within your Flutter app following Firebase's guidance: <https://console.firebase.google.com/>

### Clone the Repository

Using Git, clone the KNUST-COC Evangelism app repository to your local machine.

### Set up Firebase (if applicable)

Replace placeholder values in the project's code with your Firebase project credentials (API key, project ID, etc.).
Strictly adhere to Firebase security best practices to safeguard sensitive data.

### Run the App

Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
Execute flutter run to launch the app on a connected device or emulator.

## Project Structure (Clean Architecture)

The project adheres to the Clean Architecture principle, promoting separation of concerns and improved maintainability. Here's a general breakdown (adapt to your specific implementation):

### Data Layer

Encapsulates data access logic, interacting with Firebase (or alternative persistence mechanisms).

### Domain Layer

Represents the core business logic of the application, independent of UI or data storage concerns.
Models prospect data entities and defines relevant operations.

### Presentation Layer

Handles UI components and user interactions.
Receives data from the domain layer and presents it to the user.

### Additional Considerations

1. Error Handling: Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully manage potential issues during data access or user interactions.
2. Documentation: Maintain clear and up-to-date comments within the codebase to enhance understanding and future modifications.
